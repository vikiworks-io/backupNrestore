	2. Support for DB Password with space character
	3. Support for Website root path with space character. Example "/home/web users/html"
	4. Support for DB Name with space character
        5. Verify whether the DB username, DB password, DB name exist in some code config file before backing up. [ Otherwise we will be exporting code for this website and db for some other website]


Other Tasks:

    - dry run option to test DB, Web Root and Backup path are okay. ( config check )
    - Option to add daily backup to cron-tab with only last 2 backup persist
    - Option to add weekly backup to cron-tab with only last 2 backup persist
    - Option to check disk size before backup and report error on backup failure due to disk space limitation
